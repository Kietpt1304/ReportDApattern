# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize data from a CSV file using Python.  
It includes reading the dataset and plotting different types of charts such as line plots, bar charts, and pie charts.

## 📖 Overview

The project uses a CSV file that contains monthly sales and profit data of different products.
- Visualize results using plots for easier insights
